hangman - guess a word or die


INTRODUCTION:

   Hangman is s simple word-guessing game. You only have 8 chances to
guess the word right, otherwise a little person will be hanged.
You only have to guess single letters and letters you already
guessed appear in a list to remind you of your failure!

   Please mail any suggestions and bug reports to <bs@kniegeil.de>.
Don't blame me too hard for the ugly code. I wrote it in about 5 hours
and never ever did anything with curses before. It's also the first
C-project I work on and I code C for half a year now. But I'm always
open for a little hint to improve my code.

INSTALLATION:

   Hangman requires the curses library as a prerequisite.  If
curses is not installed on your system, you may use the free ncurses
package.  The game does not work with BSD curses, thus on BSD systems
you will need the ncurses package.
