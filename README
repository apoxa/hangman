hangman - guess a word or die


INTRODUCTION:

   Hangman is s simple word-guessing game. You only have 8 chances to
guess the word right, otherwise a little person will be hanged.
You only have to guess single letters and letters you already
guessed appear in a list to remind you of your failure!

   Please mail any suggestions and bug reports to <ben@unpatched.de>.
Don't blame me too hard for the ugly code. I wrote it in about 5 hours
and never ever did anything with curses before. It's also the first
C-project I work on and I code C for half a year now. But I'm always
open for a little hint to improve my code.

INSTALLATION:

   Hangman requires the curses library as a prerequisite.  If
curses is not installed on your system, you may use the free ncurses
package.
I actually only tested the game on FreeBSD 8.1 with curses. I don't think that
in the current state it would compile on any other system. I'm not even sure
if it compiles with ncurses. If you have fixes, please tell me.
